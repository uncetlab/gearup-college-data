# Updating NC College Data with Peterson's API

The project is in development and therefore React and Node are ran separately at the moment.

## React
1. `cd app`
2. `npm start`
3. Refer to `src` folder for React components

## Node
1. `cd api/routes`
2. Run `node api.js` to run the code in the api.js file
